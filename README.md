# covid-model

Covid-model predicts the survivability of the patient based on their lung scan. The model is a binary CNN that classifies the prognosis of the scan as survived or deceased
The untrained model is stored in CovidSurvival-Batch2.py
The data directories have been hardcoded in and must be manually edited to fit your directory
As of now test image splitting and model evaluation has not been added to CovidSurvival-Batch2.py but will be added shortly
